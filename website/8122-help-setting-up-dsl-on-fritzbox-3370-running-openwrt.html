    Hello everyone,
   </p>
<p>
    We have a DSL 100 connection. I would like to use our FritzBox 3370 running OpenWRT with it. But no matter what settings or firmware I try I just can’t get it to work. It is a VDSL2 connection with vectoring (VDSL2 17a G.Vector (ITU G.993.5)) Could someone please help make it work?
   </p>
<p>
    Thanks for your help in advance!
   </p>
