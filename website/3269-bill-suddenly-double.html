    Hello,
   </p>
<p>
    I just got the email with the bill for January 2016. It was in more than double comparing to other months.
   </p>
<p>
    I am using SMART Net 1000 for 2 years. The bill is around 13-15 EUR per month.
   </p>
<p>
    This month, it became more than 30 EUR for no-reason.
   </p>
<p>
    Could you tell me why?
   </p>
<p>
    P/s. I tried to call Hotline service but they weren't able to speak English! Too bad for a big company like T-Mobile.
   </p>
<p>
    I am wanting to terminate contract with T-Mobile and use another service provider.
   </p>

    Hello DucChung,
   </p>
<p>
    Is it possible, that we charged the yearly "Basispaket" on this bill?
   </p>
<p>
    It costs EUR 20,00 once per year.
   </p>
<p>
    We would be sorry, if you terminate your contract with us, because we are glad to have you as one of our customers.
   </p>
<p>
    Best wishes,
   </p>
<p>
    Andrea
