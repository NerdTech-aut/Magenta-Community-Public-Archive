    Hello Magenta Community,
   </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    I wanted to buy online the MagentaEINS Premium package but I am receiving the following error: "Das Angebot konnte nicht dem Warenkorb hinzugef√ºgt werden." I am sure this is a technical/website issue as I tried buying it using other browsers (Firefox, Edge, IE) and same issue was encountered. For example I tried adding to the cart the "TV M + gigakraft 250" product and everything is working fine.
   </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    I want to also acquire another contract for a second mobile phone.
   </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    I called customer support several times, but sadly no one could provide a solution.
   </p>
<p>
    Can you please help me out and advise me how should I proceed regarding the second mobile phone contract.
   </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    Thank you,
   </p>
<p>
    Best regards,
   </p>
<p>
    Andrei

    We try to help here in the Community based: User helps User.
    <br/>
    So for your request I will kindly ask you, to try it again on the telephone support.
    <br/>
    It it is a problem with the web shop, they should know that and correct that.
    <br/>
    We are also not able to look in customer accounts, because we don't have the rights for that.
    <br/>
    Hope you will get a solution for your request - maybe you can visit a shop and ask there for help?
