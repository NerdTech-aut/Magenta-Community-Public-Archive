    I have just moved to a new apartment, and have a new Magenta account, which has given me a black Home Fibre + box.
   </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    In my old apartment, I had a Tenda Mesh Wifi set up connected to my Magenta box. (I think I put the router into bridge mode in order to set this up).
   </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    However, it doesn't seem to be possible to access any kind of configuration options for the new router (nothing on 192.168.0.1, as on my old box).
   </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    Any ideas? Thanks!

    Hello

    you can test the follwoing steps:
   </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
     Instructions how to configure Tenda Nova Mesh Wifi which uses the Tenda Mesh app.
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    - Download and install the Tenda Mesh app on your smartphone or tablet.
   </p>
<p>
    - Open the app and create a new account or log in to your existing account.
   </p>
<p>
    - Power on your Tenda Nova main router and wait for it to boot up.
   </p>
<p>
    - Connect your smartphone or tablet to the Tenda Nova's default Wi-Fi network. The default SSID and password can be found on the label at the bottom of the router.
   </p>
<p>
    - Open the Tenda Mesh app and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the setup process. This will typically involve selecting your region, setting up a Wi-Fi network name and password, and creating an administrator password for the router.
   </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    If you are having trouble configuring your Tenda Mesh Wifi, you can contact Tenda support for assistance. You can find their contact information on the Tenda website. -&gt;

</p>
<p>
<strong>
     Here are some additional tips:
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    - Make sure that your Tenda Nova mesh routers are powered on and within close proximity to each other during the setup process.
   </p>
<p>
    - If you are having trouble connecting to the Tenda Nova's default Wi-Fi network, make sure that you are entering the correct SSID and password.
   </p>
<p>
    - If you are still having trouble, you can try resetting your Tenda Nova mesh routers to factory defaults. The reset button is typically located on the back of the router.
   </p>

    I hope, this helps

    Yes, the new router only has a few settings in the Mein Magenta App.

    Configuration via a web browser it not available.

<p>
    The new router does support bridge mode, but it can only be turned on by contacting technical support.
   </p>
<p>
    You don't necessarilyÂ have to put the router into bridge mode, but I can understand that you might prefer this option.
