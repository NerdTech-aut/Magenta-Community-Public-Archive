    Hello,
   </p>
<p>
    My setup is a Nvidia Shield that works as Plex server and client and my movies are stored on a NAS.
   </p>
<p>
    All connected via ethernet cable to the home network. The router is the one provided by Magenta with the 75Mbit plan.
   </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    I recently moved to Austria and got a Magenta internet contract.
   </p>
<p>
    Since I moved, my Plex server stopped being able to access the NAS that contains the movies.
   </p>
<p>
    I can see the NAS while browsing the network with the Shield by Plex server seems incapable of accessing it.
   </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    Do you have any experience with setting Plex to work with the router provided by Magenta?
   </p>
<p>
    My guess is some port that is blocked but so far I haven't been able to make it work.
   </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    I would be grateful if someone could share their experience with Plex and Magenta.
   </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    Thank you
   </p>

    Hi @duccioa,
   </p>
<p>
<br/>
    have you asked your plex-server support or other forums if there is a solution for this? Best regards, Jonathan

    Hello Jonathan,
   </p>
<p>
    After much tinkering, I suspect the problem might not be the network.
   </p>
<p>
    The error message I get is about the network but it looks like it's a corrupted Plex database problem.
   </p>
<p>
    Thank you for you answer anyway.
   </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    Best regards,
   </p>
