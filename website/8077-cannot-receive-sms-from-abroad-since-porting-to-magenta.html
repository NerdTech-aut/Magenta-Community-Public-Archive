    Let me start by apologizing for writing in English, mein Deutsch ist nicht so gut

    So, I know how weird the title sounds. Normally one would expect issues when roaming, but my wife and I are encountering the reverse problem: we can't
    <strong>
     receive
    </strong>
    any SMS from
    <strong>
     outside
    </strong>
    Austria. I'm attaching a couple of screenshots of what this looks like from the senders perspective.
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    We ported to Magenta from Spusu recently, and ever since then we just aren't getting any external messages. Messages from within Austria come through just fine, as well as calls from everywhere. Before the number migration everything used to work just fine.
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    That our family abroad can't message us is not a big deal, there are plenty of other ways for them to get in touch with us, but we've been locked out of important services which use 2FA for authentication, such as Allianz here in Austria, our medical insurance provider (which probably uses an international service for automated SMS).
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    We opened a support ticket, and Magenta has closed the issue as fixed, even though it clearly hasn't. We've tried restarting the phones (Samsung Galaxy S10 running Android 12) multiple times to no avail, and of course we've confirmed that the correct service center number is set up in both phones.
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    Anyone ever encountered this issue?
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    Thanks a lot!

     They are, yes. I followed the guide for my specific device, but in any case the correct service center number was already set. When I first entered the new SIM I received automated configuration messages from Magenta that set the proper values for SMS, internet, etc. Also, as I said, I do get messages from within Austria just fine, which I assume wouldn't be the case if something on my device was set improperly.

     Note also that the senders from abroad are getting actual errors when trying to message us. If our numbers were set up correctly in the network, they should be able to send us messages even if our phones were off, and we would receive them after we'd turned them on.

    If you can send and receive SMS with your SIM cards in Austria without any problems, the settings should fit. If other people can't send you SMS, we recommend to check if the correct phone numbers (with +43676....) are used.

    Thank you for your continued interest, but unfortunately that's not the case. Not only did I already confirm that everyone has the correct
    <strong>
     full
    </strong>
    number, but as I already mentioned, it used to work just fine when I was on Spusu
    <strong>
     with the same number
    </strong>
    . This all started happening when I migrated my number to Magenta recently, but I had the same number for four years before this, and never had this issue.

    If you suspect that it is related to the porting of your number, please clarify this again with our technical team. This will be the best solution.

    I did, and their solution was to blame every other provider in the EU except themselves. They're saying there's nothing they can do on their end. As if this is somehow a great big coincidence that it started happening the moment they took over the two numbers. I guess my remaining solutions are contract cancellation and the consumer protection agency. I had really hoped I would be able to solve this without going through so much trouble, but here we are.

    Thanks again for your interest in my issue

    Hello @vic,
   </p>
   <p>
    <br>
     it is also possible that there were SMS blocks acitvated. As written, it is best if such a request is checked by our technicians at 0676 200 7777.
